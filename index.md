My summer break was a pretty bland experience as all I did was an internship that I had no interest in. The internship's name is “WorkED” and it was cybersecurity based. I hate cybersecurity. It's too much content and it will eventually turn boring. The worst part of it was everything was group based. There were projects assigned that could’ve been solo work. It's even more irritating when you have a team member that acts as if they don’t know what they’re doing and takes credit for the work when it’s done. Enough of that now that I’m a senior there’s a lot more to ponder about such as what college I’d like to go to which I’m unsure. To be honest I don’t even wanna go to college but I’m going because I’d like a good job and a stable income. The tech job market today is trash because AI will replace the majority of us and I’m not ready to accept that.
