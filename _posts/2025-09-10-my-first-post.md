My summer break was a pretty bland experience. The only things I did were an internship and worry about the colleges I'm going to apply/go to. 

The name of the internship is "WorkED" and it's cybersecurity based. This would've been an excellent thing if I actually enjoyed cybersecurity but I don't. There's so much content and eventually you'll lose me. Sadly it was the only other tech related internship avaliable. The point of the internship  was to obviously teach the participants about cybersecurity and have them earn a certification. What I didnâ€™t like was they tried to force AI into it. No topic we did had AI and cybersecurity in the same room. We were given different projects based on different fundamentals of cybersecurity, mainly the CIA triad, which is just a complex way of making sure things are tightly secured physically and online. It was worth it now I have another certification for network security and a little extra knowledge on cybersecurity knowing it can benefit me in the real world.
