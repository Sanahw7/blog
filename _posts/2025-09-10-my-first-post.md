My summer break was a pretty bland experience. The only things I did were an internship and worry about the colleges I'm going to apply/go to. 

The name of the internship is "WorkED" and it's cybersecurity based. This would've been an excellent thing if I actually enjoyed cybersecurity but I don't. There's so much content and eventually you'll lose me. Sadly it was the only other tech related internship avaliable. The point of the internship  was to obviously teach the participants about cybersecurity and have them earn a certification. What I didn’t like was they tried to force AI into it. No topic we did had AI and cybersecurity in the same room. We were given different projects based on different fundamentals of cybersecurity, mainly the CIA triad, which is just a complex way of making sure things are tightly secured physically and online. It was worth it now I have another certification for network security and a little extra knowledge on cybersecurity knowing it can benefit me in the real world.

The transition to junior year to senior year is a lot more stressful than I thought. Already in September people are telling you to pick out your 6 CUNY schools and 7 SUNY schools, write your college essay, get your letter of recommendations and a bunch of other things that cause more stress which is why I dreaded becoming a senior. What made the college search so difficult was figuring out if I wanted to stay in my home state or move away I realized I wasn’t prepared to move away because I’ll to take care of my own expenses beside college and pick up certain skills as my parents aren’t there to help me and I have to get used to a whole new setting knowing I was used to New York. As a junior I was sure I was going to get my bachelor’s in one go, but as a senior at most CUNY schools you have to do an associates degree then transfer which was a huge disappointment to me. I’m getting much more assistance with this process and this is becoming easier to handle.
